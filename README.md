# Language adventures
My personal notes on learning programming languages

# Assumptions
I know a few languages already and that would probably color my comments
and thoughts as I explore the languages. Therefore, I might skip a few thought
nodes as I add new nodes to my tree of knowledge.

# Approach
It is usually better to have some sort of guide at the beginning so that the
attention is focused on learning the concepts and not having to navigate
through a jungle of knowledge. I will most likely choose a guiding document
if there is one available for that language.
